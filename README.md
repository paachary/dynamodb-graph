# dynamodb-graph

This repository demonstrates the design pattern in Dynamodb to store Many-to-Many Relationships using the Adjacency List Design Pattern.

For this, we are using a simple graphical representation of data shown in the attached jpeg file.

The dynamodb table consists of the PK (node) and SK (sk). It also has a global secondary index (gs_1) with "sk" as the PK.

Note that I have used [Dynamodb Local setup link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.DownloadingAndRunning.html) for testing this code.

## Setting up the data

### Configuring AWS
Configure your AWS access key and secret access key along with the desired region.

### Creating the dynamodb table
Execute createtable.sh script.

This script processes the create-table.json in the same directory as that of the script.

The script creates a table and a Global Secondary Index.

```javascript
sh createtable.sh
```
### Loading data into the dynamodb table
Execute the python script: 
```python
python main.py
```

### Querying the data using Table's PK and Global Secondary Index
```python
python query_graph_data.py
```

This script returns details for Tim (associate), his Manager (Alex) using table's PK.

Using the GSI, the query returns details for Tim's two associates (Sam and Mike).
